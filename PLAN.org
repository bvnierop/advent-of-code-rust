#+title: Implementation Plan for README Features

* Implementation Plan for README Features
This plan outlines the steps to implement the features and processes described in the README file.

** Step 1: Set Up Dependency Management [3/4]
- [X] Install Nix and Direnv on the development machine.
- [X] Create and configure `flake.nix`
- [X] Create and configure `.envrc`
- [ ] Test the setup by running a simple Rust project.

** Step 2: Organize Folder Structure
- Create the necessary directories as per the README:
  - `src/aoc`
  - `src/solutions/<year>`
  - `src/aoc-lib`
  - `input/<year>`
  - `problem/<year>`
- Ensure `.gitignore` is set up to exclude input files, problem statements, and `.session`.

** Step 3: Develop Supporting Application
- Implement the command-line application with the following commands:
  - `run`: Execute solutions with optional parameters for year, day, input file, level, and solver function.
  - `prep`: Prepare the environment for a new problem, including template creation and input download.
  - `submit`: Submit solutions with specified level and solver function.

** Step 4: Implement Solver Function Registration
- Define a macro or attribute to register solver functions with metadata (year, day, level).
- Ensure the application can dynamically discover and execute these functions.

** Step 5: Add Benchmarking and Verification
- Integrate a timing mechanism to benchmark solution execution.
- Implement output verification against expected results in `.out` files.

** Step 6: Develop Output Formatting
- Standardize the output format for solution execution, including success/failure messages and runtime.

** Step 7: Automate Problem Preparation
- Automate the creation of solution templates and input files.
- Implement a mechanism to download problem statements and inputs using the session cookie.

** Step 8: Implement Problem Submission
- Develop the HTTP POST request logic for submitting solutions.
- Handle response parsing to display submission results.

** Step 9: Testing and Validation
- Write tests for each component of the application.
- Validate the entire workflow from preparation to submission.

** Step 10: Documentation and Final Review
- Update the README with any changes made during implementation.
- Ensure all features are documented and examples are provided where necessary.
